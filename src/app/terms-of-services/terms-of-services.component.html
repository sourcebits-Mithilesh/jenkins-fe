    <p>LAST UPDATE: September 18, 2019</p>
    
    <p>NORDSON CORPORATION AND ITS AFFILIATES (“NORDSON”, “WE”, “OUR” AND “US”) PROVIDES SOFTWARE THAT MAY BE ACCESSED ONLINE OR DOWNLOADED TO YOUR SMARTPHONE OR TABLET TO ACCESS SERVICES (TOGETHER, “APP”) FOR USE IN CONJUNCTION WITH NORDSON’S PRODUCTS (“PRODUCTS”). THE TERM “SERVICES” MEANS THE APP SERVICES.</p>
    
    <p>These Terms of Service (“Terms” or “Agreement”) govern your access to and use of the Services and Products. Please read these terms carefully.</p>
    
    <p>The term “you,” as used in these Terms, means any person or entity who accesses or uses the Services or Products and any person or entity who creates an Account (as defined in Section 2(a)) and accepts these Terms, including Owners, Authorized Users (as defined in Section 2(c)), and the parents or guardians of Authorized Users, as applicable (as described in Section 1(b)(ii)). These Terms give you specific legal rights, and you may also have other legal rights in addition, which vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. THE DISCLAIMERS, EXCLUSIONS, MANDATORY AND BINDING ARBITRATION, LIMITATIONS OF LIABILITY, INDEMNIFICATION, WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL, WAIVER OF CLASS ACTION AND WAIVER OF PUNITIVE DAMAGES UNDER THESE TERMS WILL NOT APPLY TO THE EXTENT PROHIBITED BY APPLICABLE LAW. Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion of implied warranties or the exclusion or limitation of incidental or consequential damages or other rights, so those provisions of these Terms may not apply to you.</p>
    
    <p>THESE TERMS ARE A LEGAL AGREEMENT. ACCESSING AND USING THE SERVICES OR PRODUCTS, YOU ARE ACCEPTING AND AGREEING TO THESE TERMS. YOU REPRESENT AND WARRANT THAT YOU HAVE THE RIGHT, AUTHORITY, AND CAPACITY (SUBJECT TO SECTION 1(b)(ii) BELOW) TO ACCEPT AND AGREE TO THESE TERMS. YOU REPRESENT THAT YOU ARE, SUBJECT TO SECTION 1(b)(ii) BELOW, OF SUFFICIENT LEGAL AGE IN YOUR JURISDICTION OR RESIDENCE TO USE OR ACCESS THE SERVICES AND PRODUCTS AND TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT. IF YOU DO NOT AGREE WITH ANY OF THE PROVISIONS OF THESE TERMS, YOU SHOULD DISCONNECT YOUR PRODUCTS FROM YOUR ACCOUNT (AS DESCRIBED BELOW) AND CEASE ACCESSING OR USING THE SERVICES AND PRODUCTS.</p>
    
    <p>AS DESCRIBED BELOW, YOU ARE CONSENTING TO AUTOMATIC SOFTWARE UPDATE OF THE SERVICES AND OF THE PRODUCTS CONNECTED TO THE SERVICES. IF YOU DO NOT AGREE, YOU SHOULD NOT USE THE SERVICES AND PRODUCTS.</p>
    
    <p>AS DESCRIBED BELOW, SECTIONS 4 AND 5 DESCRIBE IMPORTANT LIMITATIONS OF THE SERVICES AND PRODUCTS, ESPECIALLY IN CONNECTION WITH LIFE SAFETY AND CRITICAL USES. PLEASE READ THESE DISCLOSURES CAREFULLY, AS YOU ARE ACKNOWLEDGING THEM AND ACCEPTING THEM.</p>
    
    <p><strong>1. OVERVIEW, ELIGIBILITY, CUSTOMER SERVICE, TERM AND TERMINATION</strong></p>
    
    <ol type="a">
      <li>
      <p>Overview and Relation to Other Agreements. These Terms govern your use of the Services and Products. Your purchase of any Product is governed by the Terms &amp; Conditions of Sale, and is subject to the limited warranty, if any, provided with that Product. In certain instances, there may be software embedded in the Product (and any updates thereto) (“Product Software”) and such Product Software is licensed and governed by the applicable end user license agreement (“EULA”) where applicable. Certain features of the Services may be subject to additional guidelines, terms, or rules, which will be posted on the Services in connection with such features. All additional guidelines, terms, or rules, and the Privacy Statement (“Privacy Statement”) located at <a href="http://www.nordson.com/en/our-company/ethics-and-compliance/privacy-statement" target="_blank">http://www.nordson.com/en/our-<wbr>company/ethics-and-compliance/<wbr>privacy-statement</a>, are incorporated by reference into these Terms and you are agreeing to accept and abide by them by using the Services.</p>

        <li>
        <p>You may use the Services and Products only if you have the legal capacity to form a binding agreement with us (except subject to the provisions of clause (1)(b)(ii) below), you accept these Terms by accessing or using the Services, and only if you are in compliance with these Terms and all applicable local, state/provincial, national and international laws, rules, and regulations.

    <p><strong>2. ACCOUNTS</strong></p>
    
    <ol type="a">
      <li>
      <p>When you access the App from the website or install the App from the app store that corresponds to your particular mobile device (i.e., Apple, Google, etc.), you will be asked to register with Nordson and thereby to establish an account for your BBconn Cloud devices. Establishing an account requires that you provide to Nordson your designated email address and that you select and enter a password. After entering your email address and password, you will be asked for your full name, company name, company type, company address, plant (optional), and contact telephone number. In addition to the information collected in the registration process described above, we will ask you for additional information to create your BBconn Cloud user profile such as the Nordson equipment you own, its configuration code, and serial number. After registering the App, you will be sent a verification email to the email address you provided for the purpose of verifying your account ID. You will be instructed to click on the link in the verification email to complete the registration process and to continue with your BBconn Cloud experience. Answering these questions allows us to establish and maintain your user account for the BBconn Cloud devices that you have purchased.</p>
      </li>
    </ol>
    
    <ol start="2" type="a">
      <li>
      <p>You represent and warrant that: (i) all required information you submit is truthful and accurate; (ii) you will maintain the accuracy of such information; and (iii) your use of the Services and Products will not violate any U.S. or other applicable law or regulation (e.g., you are not located in an embargoed country or are not listed as a prohibited or restricted party under applicable export control laws and regulations). You are entirely responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your Account login information and for all activities that occur under your Account. You agree to maintain your password securely to prevent others from gaining access without your permission. You agree to immediately notify us of any unauthorized use, or suspected unauthorized use, of your Account or any other breach of security. We are not liable for any loss or damage arising from your failure to comply with the above requirements.</p>
      </li>
    </ol>
    
    <ol start="3" type="a">
      <li>
      <p>The individual who creates an Account is the “owner” of that Account. Individuals who are authorized to access or otherwise provided access by the owner to an owner’s Account are “Authorized Users.” Authorized Users may have the ability to use the Services to monitor and control the Products. Authorized Users are responsible for their own actions in connection with the Products and Services, but the owner hereby agrees to be fully responsible for all actions taken by Authorized Users relating to the owner’s Products, the Services and the owner’s Account. If you are an owner who invites or enables an Authorized User, you acknowledge and agree that such Authorized User may subsequently invite or enable other Authorized Users with the same access and ability to use your Products and to use the Services set out above. As a result, if you are an owner of Products, you should authorize only those individuals that you trust to access your Account, your Products, and the Services.</p>
      </li>
    </ol>
    
    <p><strong>3. ACCESS TO SERVICES</strong></p>
    
    <ol type="a">
      <li>
      <p>Access and Use. Subject to these Terms, Nordson grants you a non-transferable, non-exclusive, right (without the right to sublicense) to access and use the Services by (i) using the Web-based Services in connection with registering and establishing a BBconn Cloud account and user profile, and for the purpose of, monitoring and ordering parts related to the Products you own or are authorized to control and monitor or otherwise accessing a service explicitly provided by Nordson for your use (the “Permitted Purpose”), and (ii) installing and using the App solely on your own handheld mobile device (e.g., iPhone, iPad, or Android smartphone) and solely for the Permitted Purpose.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
      <p>Automatic Software Updates. Nordson may from time to time develop patches, bug fixes, updates, upgrades and other modifications to improve the performance of the Services and/or the Product Software (“Updates”). These may be automatically installed without providing any additional notice or receiving any additional consent. You consent to this automatic update. If you do not want such Updates, your remedy is to terminate your Account and stop using the Services. If you do not terminate a previously created Account, you will receive Updates automatically. You acknowledge that you may be required to install Updates to use the Services and you agree to promptly install any Updates Nordson provides. Your continued use of the Services is your agreement – (i) to these Terms with respect to the Services and Products, (ii) to the EULA with respect to updated Product Software, where applicable; and (iii) any change or updates that Nordson may make to these Terms or the applicable EULA over time.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
      <p>Nordson-provided interface to Third-Party Products and Services. Over time, Nordson may provide the opportunity for you to interface the Products and Services to one or more third-party products and services, through and using the Services (“Third Party Products and Services”). You decide whether and with which Third-Party Products and Services you want to interface. When you choose to connect third party products and services to your Products, you may be shown details about any proposed exchanges of data between Nordson and the third party that is providing the product or service. In some cases, Nordson or the third party will instead (or also) ask for permission to control the products that you have connected. Your activation is required through the App or a third party Application to allow these exchanges or requests for control and the connection between a Product and a third party product or service will not be possible without your activation. You agree that Nordson may exchange information and control data regarding you and your Products, including your personal information, in order to enable the interface you have authorized. Once this information is shared with the particular Third-Party Product and Service, its use will be governed by the third party&#39;s privacy policy and not by Nordson&#39;s privacy documentation. You acknowledge and agree that Nordson makes no representation or warranty about the quality or safety of any Third-Party Products or Services or the interface with Product and Services. Accordingly, Nordson is not responsible for your use of any Third-Party Product or Service or any personal injury, death, property damage (including, without limitation, to your home, place of business or otherwise), or other harm or losses arising from or relating to your use of any Third-Party Products or Services. You should contact the third party with any questions about their Third-Party Products and Services.</p>

Nordson reserves the right to remove any Content from the Services at any time, for any reason (including, but not limited to, upon receipt of claims or allegations from third parties or authorities relating to such Content or if we are concerned that you may have breached the immediately preceding sentence), or for no reason at all.</p>
      </li>
      <li>

      <li>
      <p>Open Source. Certain items of independent, third party code may be included in the Web-based Services and/or App that are subject to certain open source licenses (“Open Source Software”). The Open Source Software is licensed under the terms of the license that accompanies such Open Source Software. Nothing in these Terms limits your rights under, or grants you rights that supersede, the terms and conditions of any applicable license agreement under which such Open Source Software is distributed or to which it is subject.</p>
      </li>
      <li>

      </li>
      <li>
      <p>Access Outside Certain Countries. Although Nordson’s websites are accessible worldwide, the Services provided or accessed through or on the Nordson websites are not available to all persons or in all countries. If you choose to access the Nordson websites from outside a country in which Nordson supports the Products and Services (“Target Country”), you do so on your own initiative and you are solely responsible for complying with applicable local laws in your country. You understand and accept that the Nordson websites are not designed for use in a non-Target Country and some or all of the features of the Nordson websites may not work or be appropriate for use in such a country.

      </li>
    </ol>
    
    <p><strong>4. AGREED USAGE AND LIMITATIONS OF NORDSON SERVICES AND PRODUCTS</strong></p>
    
    <ol type="a">
      <li>
      <p>Intended Use of Nordson Services. The Services are intended to be accessed and used for non-time-critical information and control of Products. While we aim for the Services to be highly reliable and available, they are not intended to be reliable or available 100% of the time. The Services are subject to sporadic interruptions and failures for a variety of reasons beyond Nordson’s control, including Wi-Fi or Bluetooth intermittency, power disruptions, service provider uptime, mobile notifications and carriers, among others. You acknowledge these limitations and agree that Nordson is not responsible for any damages allegedly caused by the failure or delay of the Services.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
      <p>No Life-Safety or Critical Uses of the Products and Services. You acknowledge and agree that the Products and Services, whether standing alone or when interfaced with Third-Party Products or Services are not certified for emergency response. Nordson makes no warranty or representation that use of the Products or Services with any Third-Party Product or Service will affect or increase any level of safety. YOU UNDERSTAND THAT THE PRODUCTS AND SERVICES, WHETHER STANDING ALONE OR INTERFACED WITH THIRD-PARTY PRODUCTS OR SERVICES, ARE NOT A THIRD-PARTY MONITORED EMERGENCY NOTIFICATION SYSTEM. FURTHER, YOU UNDERSTAND THAT UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES WILL NORDSON DISPATCH EMERGENCY AUTHORITIES TO YOUR HOME, PLACE OF BUSINESS OR OTHERWISE IN THE EVENT OF AN EMERGENCY.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
      <p>Reliability of Services. You acknowledge that the Services, including remote access and mobile notifications, are not error-free or 100% reliable and 100% available. Proper functioning of the Services relies and is dependent on, among other things, the transmission of data through a Bluetooth connection, your Wi-Fi network, enabled wireless device (such as a phone or tablet) and broadband internet access, or optional Cellular Backup service, for which neither Nordson nor any wireless or data carrier is responsible, and may be interrupted, delayed, refused, or otherwise limited for a variety of reasons, including insufficient coverage, power outages, termination of service and access, environmental conditions, interference, non-payment of applicable fees and charges, unavailability of radio frequency channels, system capacity, upgrades, repairs or relocations, and priority access by emergency responders in the event of a disaster or emergency (collectively “Service Interruptions”). You understand that Service Interruptions may result in the Services being unreliable or unavailable for the duration of the Service Interruption. We cannot and do not guarantee that you will receive notifications in any given time or at all. YOU AGREE THAT YOU WILL NOT RELY ON THE SERVICES FOR ANY LIFE SAFETY OR CRITICAL PURPOSES. There is no way for Nordson to provide specific information relating to a situation in your home or elsewhere. You acknowledge that it is your responsibility to educate yourself on how to respond to an emergency and to respond according to the specifics of your situation.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
      <p>Service Interruptions; no refund or rebate. The Services may be suspended temporarily without notice for security reasons, system failure, maintenance and repair, or other circumstances. You agree that you will not be entitled to any refund or rebate for such suspensions. Nordson does not offer any specific uptime guarantee for the Services.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
      <p>System Requirements. The Services may not be accessible without: (i) an Account; (iii) an enabled and supported wireless device, such as a phone or tablet (required for some features and functionalities of the Service); (iv) always-on broadband Internet access with bandwidth sufficient to support the wireless devices you use; and (v) other system elements that may be specified by Nordson. It is your responsibility to ensure that you have all required system elements and that they are compatible and properly configured. You acknowledge that the Services may not work as described when the requirements and compatibility have not been met. If you modify, substitute, move, or otherwise change any of the required system elements, it is your sole duty and responsibility to be sure they are compatible and properly configured to work with the Products and Services.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
      <p>Cellular Back-Up in Case of Wi-Fi Outage. In the event of any Service Interruptions to your Wi-Fi network or internet connection, the Services may be unreliable or unavailable for the duration of the Service Interruption. This means that features and functionalities of the Services may be unavailable on you App for the duration of the Service Interruption. You may have an option of selecting a cellular back-up subscription plan (“Cellular Backup”) to help improve connectivity in the event of any Service Interruption and decrease the likelihood of interruption of the Services and access to the various features and functionalities of the Services on your App.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
      <p>Energy Savings and other Benefits. Unless explicitly promising a “guarantee,” Nordson does not guarantee or promise any specific level of energy savings or other monetary benefit from the use of the Products or Services or any feature of them. Actual energy savings and monetary benefits vary with factors beyond Nordson’s control or knowledge.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
      <p>Product information. The Services provide you information (“Product Information”) regarding the Products. All Product Information is provided “as is” and “as available”. We cannot guarantee that it is correct or up to date. In cases where it is critical, accessing Product Information through the Services is not a substitute for direct access of the information.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
      <p>Information reliability. All information publicly posted or privately transmitted through the Services is the sole responsibility of the person from which (or from whose account) such Content originated and Nordson will not be liable for any errors or omissions in any Content. Nordson cannot guarantee the identity of any other users with whom you may interact in the course of using the Services. Additionally, we cannot guarantee the authenticity of any data that users or merchants may provide about themselves. You acknowledge that all Content accessed by you using the Services is at your own risk and you will be solely responsible for any damage or loss to any party resulting therefrom. We cannot control and have no duty to take any action regarding how you may interpret and use the Content or what actions you may take as a result of having been exposed to the Content, and you hereby release us from all liability for you having acquired or not acquired Content through the Services.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
      <p>Representations. You warrant, represent and agree that you will not contribute any Content or otherwise use the Services or Products in a manner that (i) infringes or violates the intellectual property rights or proprietary rights, rights of publicity or privacy, or other rights of any third party; (ii) violates any law, statute, ordinance or regulation or is otherwise illegal; (iii) is harmful, fraudulent, deceptive, threatening, abusive, harassing, tortious, defamatory, vulgar, obscene, libelous, or otherwise objectionable; (iv) impersonates any person or entity, including without limitation any employee or representative of Nordson; (v) contains a virus, trojan horse, worm, time bomb, or other harmful computer code, file, or program; (vi) jeopardizes the security of your Nordson Account or anyone else’s Account (such as allowing someone else to log in to the Services as you); (vii) attempts, in any manner, to obtain or access the password, account, products, devices, systems, or other security information from any other user or third party; (viii) violates the security of any computer network, or cracks any passwords or security encryption codes; (ix) runs Maillist, Listserv, or any form of auto-responder or “spam” on the Services, or any processes that otherwise interfere with the proper working of the Services (including by placing an unreasonable load on the Services’ infrastructure); (x) copies or stores any significant portion of the Content; (xi) decompiles, reverse engineers, or otherwise attempts to obtain the source code or underlying ideas or information of or relating to the Services; (xii) denigrates or disrupts any network capacity or functionality; (xiii) control equipment in hazardous environments or emergency services requiring fail-safe performance in which the failure of such software programs could lead directly to death, personal injury, or severe physical or environmental damage or (xiv) engages in remote monitoring to provide professional medical care for any individual, including without limitation, in any health care and assisted living environment.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
      <p>Installation, test and use. It is your responsibility to install and use the Products and Services pursuant to the applicable manual and instructions. It is your responsibility to test the Products once installed to be sure the Products (and any related components) are functioning and communicating as intended and designed, and then regularly test and maintain the Products after installation.</p>
      </li>
    </ol>
    
    <p><strong>5. LIMITATIONS OF NORDSON SERVICES DUE TO THIRD PARTIES</strong></p>
    
    <ol type="a">
      <li>
      <p>General. The Services rely on or interoperate with third party products and services. These third-party products and services are beyond Nordson’s control, but their operation may impact or be impacted by the use and reliability of the Services. You acknowledge and agree that: (i) the use and availability of the Services is dependent on third party product vendors and service providers, (ii) these third-party products and services may not operate in a reliable manner 100% of the time, and they may impact the way that the Services operate, and (iii) Nordson is not responsible for damages and losses due to the operation of these third-party products and services.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
      <p>Third Party Service Providers Used by Nordson. You acknowledge that Nordson uses third party service providers to enable some aspects of the Services – such as, for example, data storage (e.g., Amazon Web Services and Microsoft Azure), Cellular Backup, synchronization, and mobile device notifications through mobile operating system vendors and mobile carriers. YOU AGREE NOT TO RELY ON THE SERVICES FOR ANY LIFE SAFETY OR TIME-CRITICAL PURPOSES. FURTHER, TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, YOU AGREE TO RELEASE AND HOLD HARMLESS THIRD-PARTY SERVICE PROVIDERS FROM ALL LIABILITY, DAMAGES OR LOSSES OF ANY KIND OR SORT, PERSONAL INJURY OR LOSS OF LIFE ARISING FROM YOUR USE OF THE PRODUCTS AND SERVICES.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
      <p>Equipment, ISP, and carrier. You acknowledge that the availability of the Services is dependent on (i) your computer, mobile device, wiring, Wi-Fi network, Bluetooth connection, and other related equipment (“Equipment”), (ii) your Internet service provider (“ISP”), and (iii) your mobile device carrier (“Carrier”). You acknowledge that you are responsible for all fees charged by your ISP and Carrier in connection with your use of the Services. You also acknowledge that you are responsible for compliance with all applicable agreements, terms of use/service, and other policies of your ISP and Carrier.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
      <p>App Stores. You acknowledge and agree that the availability of the App is dependent on the third-party websites from which you download the App, e.g., the App Store from Apple or the Android app market from Google (each an “App Store”).
